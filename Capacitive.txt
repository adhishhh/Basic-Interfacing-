Connect the capacitive sensor to the breadboard and connect the breadboard to the Arduino.

Connect one leg of the sensor to the Arduino's ground pin and the other leg to a digital pin on the Arduino.

In the Arduino IDE, create a new sketch and include the CapacitiveSensor library.

Define the pin to which the sensor is connected using the CapacitiveSensor library.

Initialize the capacitive sensor using the CapacitiveSensor library.

In the loop function, use the CapacitiveSensor library to read the value of the sensor.

Use the value of the sensor to perform some action, such as turning on an LED or triggering a sound.

CapacitiveSensor library is used to read the value of the sensor and perform an action based on the value. The value of the sensor is printed to the serial monitor and used to turn on or off the built-in LED on the Arduino board.
