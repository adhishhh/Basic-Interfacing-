Connect the soil moisture sensor to the Arduino board.
Connect the VCC pin of the sensor to the 5V pin of the Arduino, 
the GND pin of the sensor to the GND pin of the Arduino,
and the signal pin of the sensor to any of the analog
input pins of the Arduino (for example, A0).

Upload the following code to the Arduino board.
This code reads the analog value from the soil 
moisture sensor and converts it to a percentage value.
